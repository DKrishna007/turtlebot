!) First, you need to start the ROS master node:

bash
{
roscore
}

2) Then, in a new terminal, start the turtlesim node:

bash
{
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
}

3) Now, you can spawn the turtles. The turtlesim package provides a service called "spawn" that allows you to spawn a new turtle at a specified location and orientation. You can call this service using the "rosservice" command.

In goals 4,5,6 to spawn the Robber Turtle (RT) at location (5, 5) with an orientation of 0 radians, you can use the following command:

bash
{
rosservice call /spawn "x: 5.0
y: 5.0
theta: 0.0
name: 'robber_turtle'"
}

4) To spawn the Police Turtle (PT) at a random location 10 seconds after the RT is launched, you can use a similar command. However, you'll need to replace the x and y coordinates with the desired values for the PT's initial location:

bash
{
sleep 10
rosservice call /spawn "x: 8.0
y: 8.0
theta: 0.0
name: 'police_turtle'"
}
y: 8.0
theta: 0.0
name: 'police_turtle'"
Please note that the "sleep 10" command is used to wait for 10 seconds
