# Robotics Assignment

This repository contains the code, videos, and report for the Robotics Assignment. The assignment focuses on achieving specific goals using ROS and TurtleSim. The implemented goals include PID control for turtle navigation, creating grid patterns while considering acceleration and deceleration, enabling turtle rotation in circles with pose publishing, and simulating chase scenarios between turtles with varying speeds. Additionally, an enhancement involves estimating positions from noisy poses.

## Goals

1. Control turtle: Implement PID control for efficient navigation.
2. Make grid: Create a grid pattern using turtle's movement while considering acceleration and deceleration limitations.
3. Rotate turtle in a circle: Program the turtle to move in circles, publishing its pose and a noisy pose.
4. Chase turtle fast: Simulate a chase scenario between two turtles, with the Police Turtle attempting to catch the Robber Turtle.
5. Chase turtle slow: Extend the chase scenario, with the Police Turtle moving at a slower speed compared to the Robber Turtle.
6. Chase turtle noisy: Enhance the chase scenario by estimating the Robber Turtle's position based on its noisy pose.

## Code Usage

1. Install ROS and the required packages (`turtlesim` and `geometry_msgs`).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Make sure your ROS environment is set up properly.
4. Run the Python script for the desired goal using the `python` command.

## Videos

The `videos` directory contains screen recordings showcasing the achieved goals for reference.

## Report

The `report` directory contains a detailed report summarizing the approach to the problem, explaining any assumptions made, reasoning behind the choice of algorithms/tools, and showcasing results through graphs and videos.

## Additional Notes

- The code is written in Python and requires the installation of ROS and the necessary packages.
