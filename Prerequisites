Usage:


Start the ROS master node:
roscore


In a new terminal, start the turtlesim node:
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node


Spawn the turtles using the following commands:

To spawn the Robber Turtle (RT) at location (5, 5) with an orientation of 0 radians:
bash
rosservice call /spawn "x: 5.0 y: 5.0 theta: 0.0 name: 'robber_turtle'"


To spawn the Police Turtle (PT) at a random location 10 seconds after the RT is launched:
bash
sleep 10
rosservice call /spawn "x: 8.0 y: 8.0 theta: 0.0 name: 'police_turtle'"


Run the Python code for the desired goal. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located and make it executable:
bash
chmod +x goal4.py


Execute the Python file using rosrun:
rosrun my_package goal4.py

Observe the simulation in the turtlesim window and monitor the terminal for any output or error messages related to the Python code.

Once the simulation is complete, close the turtlesim window and terminate the ROS nodes by pressing Ctrl+C in the respective terminal windows.
